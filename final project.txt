Objective

The objective is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on images of these digits.

Data Source

We'll use the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known dataset of handwritten digits. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each grayscale and 28x28 pixels in size.

Import Libraries

We'll primarily use TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the neural network, along with some standard data manipulation and visualization libraries.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

Import Data

Load the MNIST dataset using Keras:

python
Copy code
# Load dataset
(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
Describe Data
The dataset consists of:

train_images: Training images (60,000 images, 28x28 pixels each)
train_labels: Labels for the training images (0 to 9)
test_images: Test images (10,000 images, 28x28 pixels each)
test_labels: Labels for the test images (0 to 9)
Data Visualization
Visualize some of the images to understand the dataset better:

python
Copy code
# Display some images from the dataset
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
for i in range(25):
    plt.subplot(5, 5, i+1)
    plt.xticks([])
    plt.yticks([])
    plt.grid(False)
    plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary)
    plt.xlabel(train_labels[i])
plt.show()
Data Processing
Normalize the Data:
Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1:

python
Copy code
train_images = train_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images / 255.0
Reshape the Data:
Reshape images to 4D tensors (batch_size, height, width, channels):

python
Copy code
train_images = train_images.reshape(train_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
test_images = test_images.reshape(test_images.shape[0], 28, 28, 1)
One-Hot Encoding:
Convert labels to categorical format:

python
Copy code
train_labels = to_categorical(train_labels)
test_labels = to_categorical(test_labels)
Define Target Variable (y) and Feature Variables (X)
Target Variable (y): train_labels and test_labels
Feature Variables (X): train_images and test_images
Train-Test Split
Split the training data into training and validation sets:

python
Copy code
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(train_images, train_labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Modeling
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model:

python
Copy code
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model on the test data:

python
Copy code
test_loss, test_accuracy = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_accuracy}')
Prediction
Use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

python
Copy code
predictions = model.predict(test_images)


Explanation
Data Preparation: We loaded and preprocessed the MNIST dataset, including normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding.
Model Building: Constructed a CNN model using Keras with convolutional layers, pooling layers, flattening, and dense layers.
Model Training: Trained the model on the training data and evaluated its performance using validation data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the trained model on the test set to determine its accuracy.
Prediction: Used the trained model to predict the labels of unseen test data.
This approach provides a comprehensive pipeline for handwritten digit prediction using Python, leveraging deep learning techniques with TensorFlow/Keras. Adjustments to the model architecture and hyperparameters can further improve accuracy based on specific requirements and experimentation.
